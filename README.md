This was a simple weekend project aimed to help me learn about javascript and the use of JSON files.

The game is quite simple, each locattion has up to three choices. 

The JS checkes the input from the text box against the current choices, once matched, it will look at the value in the JSON file which points towards the index of the output value.

The output value then points towards a new set of choices. 

Simple and easy! 

Once the initial JS functions were setup, the rest of the project was simply editing the JSON file in order to form the story.
